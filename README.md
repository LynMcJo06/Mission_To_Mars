Module 10:  Web Scraping with HTML/CSS
Robin is a junior scientist and would like to work for NASA.  She is fascintated by space, especially Mars and wants to gather as much information from web sources.  She has put together a web scraping project, which will be performed in this module.  
## Lesson 1:  Getting Started Using Web Scraping Tools
I downloaded several libraries, a web driver, Mongo a document database, and other tools to work on this module.  I believe everything is working properly.  
## Lesson 2:  Operating the Window to the Internet
I learned about hypertext markup language (HTML).  HTML is coding language used to create webpages.  I created a small webpage.  Since Robin is interesting in NASA Mars missions, I looked at the NASA website and inspected its HTML code using Chrome Developer Tools.  I have a better understanding of how website are created and the complexity that developers undergo in designing a webpage.
